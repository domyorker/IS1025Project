This is my most recent progress. 

Steve....we need a resume web service (I can work on that) that will spit back a resume or...
a list of resume headings (studentID, resumeID, studentName, resumeTitle). So we need the resume class
to provide a getHeading() method that returns a json object (jsonResumeHeader) with the fields above.

Sean....you will be able to call the web service from a page (browse and view) to obtain a resume list or single resume object
as json.

Jose...working on resume UI. So far I create a Resume object on which to enter data from author.jsp
